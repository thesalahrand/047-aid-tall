## 🎯 Project Overview

I successfully completed a **Fiverr order** on **December 21, 2024**. It was a **one-time project**, and I’m unable to provide access to the live version.

To showcase my work, I’ve decided to **rebuild the project** by covering some of its core requirements. I've **simplified a few features** and **added some new ones**, so it's **not a direct clone** of the original. This serves as one of my **portfolio projects**, aimed at demonstrating my skills as a **Laravel developer**.

This is the **TALL Stack** version of the project.
